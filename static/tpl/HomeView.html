              <h3>About The App</h3>
              <p> Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a parlor game based on the "six degrees of separation" concept,
                  which posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart.
                  That idea eventually morphed into this parlor game, wherein movie buffs challenge each other
                  to find the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and prolific Hollywood
                  character actor Kevin Bacon. It rests on the assumption that any individual involved in the Hollywood,
                  California, film industry can be linked through his or her film roles to Kevin Bacon within six steps.
                  The game requires a group of players to try to connect any such individual to Kevin Bacon as quickly
                  as possible and in as few links as possible. It can also be described as a trivia game based on
                  the concept of the small world phenomenon. In 2007, Bacon started
                  a charitable organization named <a href="http://SixDegrees.org">SixDegrees.org</a>.
