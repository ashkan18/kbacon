              <h3>About The App</h3>
              <p> Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a parlor game based on the "six degrees of separation" concept,
                  which posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart.
                  That idea eventually morphed into this parlor game, wherein movie buffs challenge each other
                  to find the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and prolific Hollywood
                  character actor Kevin Bacon. It rests on the assumption that any individual involved in the Hollywood,
                  California, film industry can be linked through his or her film roles to Kevin Bacon within six steps.
                  The game requires a group of players to try to connect any such individual to Kevin Bacon as quickly
                  as possible and in as few links as possible. It can also be described as a trivia game based on
                  the concept of the small world phenomenon. In 2007, Bacon started
                  a charitable organization named <a href="http://SixDegrees.org">SixDegrees.org</a>.

              <h3>Get The Code!</h3>

              <p>
                  This app is written in Python(Flask), Bootstrap and Backbone.
              </p>
              <p>
                  On the back-end, we have three layers.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Interface layer: Where we define the routes and endpoints</li>
                    <li>Services layer: Where we have the core logic for example finding the path from each artist
                    to Kevin Bacon</li>
                    <li>Data layer: Which handles storing and fetching the data from the data structure.</li>
                  </ul>
                  On the front-end, I used bootstrap to get the proper layout and css classes, and used backbone for
                  handling client side logic, calling to server and render the ui.
